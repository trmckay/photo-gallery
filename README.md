Source code for my photo gallery at [photos.trmckay.com](https://photos.trmckay.com/). I use [thumbsup](https://thumbsup.github.io) via Docker to generate a static site from images and Caddy (again, Docker) as the webserver. DNS and SSL are all configured automatically with the Caddy Cloudflare plugin. This is all hosted on a tiny VPS fronted by Cloudflare.
